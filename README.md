# What happens when you type https://www.google.com and press Enter

This project is part of Holberton School’s curriculum.  
It explores what happens under the hood when a user types a URL in a browser and presses **Enter**.

The goal is to practice explaining technical concepts clearly and to illustrate the web infrastructure flow from the client to the server.
